    <h2>About Me:
        <p> Howdy! My name is Spencer, and I am a junior computer science major from Katy, Texas. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Texas A&M University in College Station.  
            I grew up in a very chaotic family which includes my parents, three younger siblings, two dogs, and a cat. 
            Outside of school, I love fashion, traveling, videography, music, and new technology. 
            I believe I pick up more hobbies than I can afford. My current, favorite hobby is bowling. Four of my roomates and I are taking the bowling class this semester.
            Growing up, I participated in lots of sports. Despite my active childhood, I am extremely lazy. I love laying in bed all day.
            Too bad school and work require me to get up! Speaking of work, I currently work at the IT Help Desk for our college of engineering. 
            I pretty much only work for two reasons. One, I'm extremely materialistic and love buying things. 
            Two, I have to support my son (cat). I'm not sure what else to say about myself because the rest of it is inlcuded in this website.
