                        I would describe my proficiency in Python, C++, and Git the highest because that is the language that I currently use most in class and for personal use. I have used Java, Assembly, R, and MATLAB for past classes and my internship. I would describe my proficiency in these languages as average. The last 3 languages listed are for web development. I am new to web development, so I rated my proficiency the lowest for these languages. 
                    <p class="qual_p">Knowledge of:

                <h2 class="qual_h2">Technical Areas of Interest</h2>
                <p class="qual_p">I am interested in becoming a software engineer for a tech company or further pursuing machine learning/data science.
                    Software engineering is my first option because I enjoy the process of creating something that can
                    be used by others. I believe software engineering is a field that will allow me to continue learning throughtout my career. On another note, I
                    am interested in machine learning/data science because I find it fascinating how we can use data to make predictions and decisions. Machine learning is also something versatile that can be implemented in many diffrent systems.
