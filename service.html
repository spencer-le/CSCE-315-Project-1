                Service has been a major part of my college experience. During my freshman year, I joined a Freshmen Leadership Organization called 
                Memorial Student Center Freshmen In Service and Hosting (MSC FISH). 
                Through this organization, I learned the impact you can create just by setting aside time to help others. 
                Within this organization, I took on a leadership position to host service events like FLO Bowl and Kyle Field Day. 
                These events had upwards of 1,500 attendees and helped me spread the gift of service. 
                On top of hosting events, we regularly volunteered at places like the Houston Food Bank, Isaih's Place, The Big Event, and much more. 
                Another way I give back to the community, more specifically, Texas A&M is through mentorship. 
                I was a Fish Camp counselor and an Engineering Summer Bridge Program peer mentor. 
                Through these programs, I helped guide incoming Aggies through our countless traditions and the fear of leaving home.
